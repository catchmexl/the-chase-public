# The Chase - Game Rules

This directory contains the official game rules for **The Chase**, an urban chase game where Escapers try to evade Chasers within a city.

## Structure

The rules are organized into individual markdown files for maintainability and are managed through a manifest file.

### Files

- **`rules.json`** - Manifest file defining all rule sections, their order, and metadata
- **`rules_manifest.schema.json`** - JSON Schema for validating the manifest structure
- **Individual rule files:**
  - `objective.md` - Game objective and winning conditions
  - `preparation.md` - Team setup and game duration
  - `gameplay.md` - Three phases of gameplay
  - `trigger-zones.md` - Clue Points and their effects
  - `tips-chasers.md` - Strategic tips for Chaser teams
  - `tips-escapers.md` - Strategic tips for Escaper team
  - `fair-play.md` - Fair play rules and safety guidelines

## Manifest Structure

The `rules.json` manifest follows this structure:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-10-29T12:00:00Z",
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "objective",
      "title": "Objective",
      "file": "objective.md",
      "category": "core",
      "order": 1,
      "description": "The main goal of the game"
    }
    // ... more rules
  ]
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- **`version`** - Semantic version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **`lastUpdated`** - ISO 8601 timestamp of last update
- **`rules`** - Array of rule sections with:
  - **`id`** - Unique identifier (kebab-case)
  - **`title`** - Display title for the section
  - **`file`** - Markdown filename
  - **`category`** - One of: `core`, `mechanics`, `tips`, `conduct`
  - **`order`** - Display order (lower numbers first)
  - **`description`** - Optional short description

## Categories

Rules are grouped into four categories:

1. **Core** - Essential game rules (objective, preparation, gameplay)
2. **Mechanics** - Game mechanics and features (trigger zones)
3. **Tips** - Strategic advice for players
4. **Conduct** - Fair play and safety guidelines

## Updating Rules

### 1. Edit Content

Update the relevant `.md` file with your changes. Follow these guidelines:

- Use proper markdown formatting
- Keep content concise and clear
- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold important terms
- Keep line length reasonable (80-100 characters)

### 2. Update Manifest

If adding/removing/reordering rules:

1. Edit `rules.json`
2. Update `version` number:
   - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (structure changes, removed rules)
   - **MINOR**: New rules or significant additions
   - **PATCH**: Small fixes, typos, clarifications
3. Update `lastUpdated` timestamp

### 3. Validate Changes

Run the validation script (if available):

```bash
node validate-rules.js
```

Or manually validate:
1. Check that all files referenced in `rules.json` exist
2. Verify JSON syntax with a validator
3. Ensure markdown renders correctly
4. Check that manifest follows the schema

### 4. Update Changelog
