# Tips for the Escapers

Staying ahead of the **Chasers** requires quick thinking and strategic planning. Here are some tips to help you survive:

## Use Clue Points to Block the Chasers

- Each **Clue Point can only be used once**, so activating one prevents the **Chasers** from using it later
- **Be careful:** Clue Points **reveal your location**, so use them wisely

## Plan for the Final Walk

After **1 hour 30 minutes**, you **can only move on foot**.

- Make sure you end up somewhere with **multiple escape routes**
- Avoid open areas with limited exits
- Stay in areas with good cover and crowds

## Stay Unpredictable

- Don't follow obvious patterns
- Change transportation methods frequently
- Use unexpected routes

## Use Time to Your Advantage

- Monitor the clock carefully
- Save energy for the final phase
- Use the head start wisely to gain maximum distance

## Coordinate as a Team

- Stay together (it's a rule!)
- Make decisions quickly
- Have backup plans ready

**Stay together, think ahead, and keep the Chasers guessing!**
