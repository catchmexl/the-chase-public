Throughout the game, players can interact with **Clue Points** (also called **Trigger Zones**) marked on the map. Activating a Clue Point gives teams specific advantages.

## How Clue Points Work

- **Activation:** Teams must physically go to the Clue Point and press **Activate** in the app
- **Usage:** Each Clue Point can only be used **once per game**
- **Effect Direction:**
  - If a **Chaser team** activates a Clue Point, the **Escapers** are affected
  - If the **Escaper team** activates a Clue Point, **all Chaser teams** are affected
- **Cooldowns:** Some Clue Points have cooldowns to prevent immediate repeated use
- **Location Reveal:** Activating a Clue Point **reveals your location** in the game log, so use them wisely!
