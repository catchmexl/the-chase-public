To maximize your chances of catching the **Escapers**, teamwork and strategy are key. Here are some essential tips:

## Split Up & Cover More Ground

Instead of all teams chasing the **Escapers** together, **divide your forces**.

- Spread out to **cover different areas** and increase your chances of spotting them

## Use Clue Points Strategically

Don't activate Clue Points randomly — time them for **maximum impact**.

- If you suspect the **Escapers** are about to take a new route, use **"Live Location"** to reveal their location
- **"Freeze"** works best when you are close and need to slow them down

## Divide Tasks Among Teams

- One Chaser team can focus on **activating Clue Points** to limit the Escapers' escape options
- The other teams can **move in the direction of the Escapers**, cutting off possible escape routes

## Predict & Block Escape Routes

Think like an Escaper — where would you go next?

- Use the metro map and major intersections to **anticipate their movements** and set up traps

## Stay Coordinated

Communication between Chaser teams is crucial. Share information about:

- Clue Point activations
- Suspected Escaper locations
- Transportation patterns

**By combining these tactics, the Chasers can corner the Escapers and make the final capture much easier!**
