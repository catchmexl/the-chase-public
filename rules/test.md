To maximize your chances of catching the **Escapers**, teamwork and strategy are key. Here are some essential tips:

**Split Up & Cover More Ground**
Instead of all teams chasing the **Escapers** together, divide your forces.
Spread out to **cover different areas** and increase your chances of spotting them.

**Use Trigger Zones Strategically**
Don't activate Trigger Zones randomly — time them for **maximum impact**.
If you suspect the **Escapers** are about to take a new route, use **"Live Location"** to reveal their location.
**"Freeze"** works best when you are close and need to slow them down.

**Divide Tasks Among Teams**
One Chaser team can focus on **activating Trigger Zones** to limit the Escapers' escape options.
The other teams can **move in the direction of the Escapers**, cutting off possible escape routes.

**Predict & Block Escape Routes**
Think like an Escaper—where would you go next?
Use the metro map and major intersections to **anticipate their movements** and set up traps.

By combining these tactics, the **Chasers** can corner the **Escapers** and make the final capture much easier!

**Use Trigger Zones to Block the Chasers**
Each **Trigger Zone can only be used once**, so activating one prevents the **Chasers** from using it later.
But be careful Trigger Zones **reveal your location**, so use them wisely.

**Plan for the Final Walk**
After **1 hour 30 minutes**, you **can only move on foot**.
Make sure you end up somewhere with **multiple escape routes** and avoid open areas with limited exits.

**Stay Unpredictable**

**Use Time to Your Advantage**

Stay together, think ahead, and keep the **Chasers** guessing!
