# Game Play

The game is divided into three distinct phases, each with different rules and strategies.

## Phase 1: Head Start (First 15 minutes)

- The **Escapers** are free to move immediately once the game starts
- The **Chaser teams** must wait **15 minutes** before beginning their pursuit

## Phase 2: Chase (From 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes)

- The **Chasers** are now actively tracking down the **Escapers**
- The **Clue Points** help track down the Escapers
- Activate the Clue Points in the city (see **Trigger Zones** section for more information)

## Phase 3: Closing In (Final 30 minutes)

- The **Escapers** are **only allowed to move on foot** from this point onward
- The chase intensifies as the Chasers narrow down the Escapers' location
